## Deliberately excluded

The plan is an internal commercial document. None of the following is in the
brochure: revenue targets, commission estimates, cost estimates, profit targets,
% change vs prior year, marketing budget, operational KPIs and their targets,
delegate-acquisition milestones ("retain 15, acquire 35"), confirmation-date
milestones, and the internal team/ownership table. The only person named is the
partnerships sales contact.

## Judgement calls — worth a second opinion

1. ~~**LatAm dates**~~ — **resolved, 26 Aug 2026.** PLAN slide 1 says
   "15 – 18 November 2027", but the same deck labels the format "3 days & 2
   nights" and its own day-by-day schedule (slide 5) runs 15 / 16 / 17 Nov.
   The 2026 edition was 17–19 Nov, also three days. **15–17 November 2027 is
   confirmed correct** (Stuart); slide 1 is the error. If the deck is reissued,
   slide 1 needs fixing rather than this repo.

2. **Feedback scores are prior-edition, not 2026.** The scores shown are the
   "C-LEVEL FEEDBACK" panels from BR26 p7. The Cyprus panel's own question
   wording dates it to the **Retreat Europe 2024** edition ("…at the NEXT.io
   Retreat Europe 2024?", "…returning to the NEXT.io Retreat Europe 2025?").
   The LatAm panel carries no year, so the page labels it "most recent edition"
   rather than asserting a year it may not have.

   The PLAN's KPI slides (9 and 10) also carry numbers like 9.2 and 9.8, but
   those are **targets** — each is annotated "to be reviewed after the event",
   and the 2026 events had not happened when the deck was written. They are
   therefore *not* used as achieved results anywhere in the brochure.

   **Action:** once the Oct/Nov 2026 surveys are in, replace
   `DESTINATIONS[x].feedback` with the real 2026 numbers and drop the
   prior-edition caveat from `feedback.source`.

3. **"Fifty C-level guests attend on us."** The brochure states the delegate
   economics plainly — complimentary operators/affiliates/influencers are what
   the partner fee funds. This is a strength when selling to suppliers, and the
   50/50 balance is already public in BR26, but the framing is a presentational
   choice rather than something the source documents say outright. Approved for
   publication 26 Aug 2026; soften the copy in `TheRoom` if that changes.

4. **Individual Ticket deliverables.** PLAN slide 7 gives only price,
   availability and "1 PASS" for this product. The bullet list in `PACKAGES`
   describes what an all-inclusive delegate pass covers, inferred from the
   retreat format — it invents no entitlement, but it has not been checked
   against a signed spec.

5. **Europe's "Yacht / Golf" card uses a padel photograph.** The 2027 product
   is named "Yacht / Golf"; the equivalent 2026 Cyprus product was
   "Golf/Padel Tournament" at the same €20,000, and padel is the only
   tournament photography available for Cyprus. The card copy covers golf,
   padel and a boat day. Swap the image if a golf or boat shot exists.

6. **Two LatAm logos read oddly** because the source brochure art is small:
   `betjara` and `betsw` are best-guess filenames for marks whose wordmarks are
   hard to resolve at source resolution. The images are correct; only the
   filenames and `alt` text are a guess.
